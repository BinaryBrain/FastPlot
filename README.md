FastPlot
========

A fast, easy but inaccurate graph maker.

I made it because I think WolframAlpha and other online graphers are too slow when you just want to plot some functions to see how do they look.
This grapher use javascript to plot function instead of running it on server's side, so you have not to wait for communications.
